# Telecom plans analysis
The project from the SDA sprint of the Practicum DA/DS course.

## Description
Here we have a small dataset of various data on 500 Megaline clients. We would like to know if one of the prepaid plans (Surf and Ultimate) brings in more revenue.

First, we should do some data preprocessing: fill in the missing values, clean spelling errors, and change data types. Also, we need to add some new columns that will help in our analysis. After doing so, we could explore our data and test hypotheses. 

## Conclusion
